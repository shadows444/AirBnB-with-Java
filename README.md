# AirBnB-with-Java
This is my biggest project unitl today, a program like AirBnB done with Java, hope it helps you.
This proect was done with Java with Apache NetBeans IT DOES NOT USE DATABASE because is a first year of CSS degree, it uses text files to keep data about users, houses and bookings.
This is all OOP I hope you enjoy it and find it helpful.
You can also donate me on Patreon if you want, but I do not do this for money I do it for educational purposes: patreon.com/Shadowsofwar.
